Requires at least: 3.0
Tested up to: 3.3
Stable tag: 2.3.3

Allows users to upload, manage, search, and download publications, documents, and similar content (PDF, Power-Point, etc.).

== Description ==

WP Publication Archive adds a custom content type for storing, tagging, and categorizing downloadable content external to
standard WordPress posts and pages.  You can add downloadable PDF files, Word documents, and PowerPoint presentations.
These files will be stored in the standard WordPress uploads directory but will be managed separately through a custom
post type interface in the WordPress admin area.

*This plugin requires PHP5*

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire `wp-publication-archive` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Use the "Add Publications" menu to begin adding publications.
1. Use the built-in menu system to manage your publications.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I upload a new file? =

Use the built-in media uploader on the "Add Publication" screen.  This is a change from previous versions where you could manually specify the full URL of the attachment.  That format exposed your site to a potential security vulnerability and has been removed.

= OK, will I be able to use remote files in the future? =

Absolutely!  A future version will better handle fully-qualified filenames and once again allow for remote URLs.  Unfortunately, that version might take a few more months to polish enough for release ...

= How do I list my publications? =

You can display a list of publications either by includeing the [wp-publication-archive] shortcode on a post/page or by placing <?php wp_publication_archive(); ?> in your theme template files.  WordPress will render your publication list automatically.

= Can I filter the list by category =

Yes!  Just include `categories="cat-1,cat2"` in your shortcode where "cat-1" and "cat-2" are the *slugs* of the categories you want to display.

= Can I filter the list by author? =

Yes!  Just include `author="author-name"` in your shortcode where "author-name" is the *slug* of the author you want to display.

= What File Types are Available =

By default, the plug-in contains icons for several common file types.  The icons include:

- Standard document files
- Spreadsheet formats (i.e. Excel, Open Office Calc)
- Video
- Image
- Audio
- Adobe PDF
- Zip

All other file types will feature a generic "file" icon.
